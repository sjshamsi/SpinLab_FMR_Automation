    "- **PS Output Current (A)** shows the measured power supply current in Amperes. It's a bit out of wack because the set current is actually 0.\n",
    "- **PS Output Voltage (V)** shows the measured power supply voltage in Volts. Same reason as the measurent current for why it isn't 0.\n",
    "- **PS Output Mode (Current/Voltage)** shows whether the power supply is in constant current or constant voltage mode.\n",
    "- **SG Frequency** is the RF output level from the signal generator.\n",
    "- **SG RF Output** shows if the signal generator's RF output is on.\n",
    "- **SG RF Output Level** shows the RF output's level in dB.\n",
    "- **LIA Time Constant** shows the time constant for our lock-in amplifier in seconds.\n",
    "- **LIA Sensivity** shows the absolute largest signal it can measure in the current sensivity setting. The sensivity is in Volts or Amperes depending on the measurement setting.\n",
    "- **Sensivity Delay (s)** is the amount of time (in seconds) paused when the LIA sensivity is changed. This is because some time is required after changing the sensivity before stable reading can be achieved.\n",
    "- **Read Repetitions** is the amount of readings taken per measurement of A and B. More readings give us a more stable, accurate result.\n",
    "- **Read Repetition Delay** is the amount of time (in seconds) between reach read repitition.\n",
    "- **Repetition Averaging Function** is the function which creates a measurement from our repeated readings. By default, this is a simple mean function (`np.mean`). However, sometimes, you want to do more complex averagings than a simple mean. For instance, the experiment class also has a method called `avg_mid_50` which takes in an array as argument, and returns the mean of the middle $50^{th}$ percentile of array elements. This can help stabilise erratic measurements, especially at higher frequencies.\n",
    "- **Read Delay** is the delay (in seconds) after the frequency or field is changed, before a measurement is taken.\n",
    "- **From 0 Delay** is the delay (in seconds) after the frequency or field begins from 0 (occurs when initial parameters are being set), before a measurement is made.\n",
