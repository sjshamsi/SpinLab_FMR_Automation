    "Great! We've iniialised an `Experiment` object and have named it `E`. Once initialised, a bunch of experiment parameters get printed out. Let's go over them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PS Output Current (A)** shows the measured power supply current in Amperes. It's a bit out of wack because the set current is actually 0.\n",
    "- **PS Output Voltage (V)** shows the measured power supply voltage in Volts. Same reason as the measurent current for why it isn't 0.\n",
    "- **PS Output Mode (Current/Voltage)** shows whether the power supply is in constant current or constant voltage mode.\n",
    "- **SG Frequency** is the RF output level from the signal generator.\n",
    "- **SG RF Output** shows if the signal generator's RF output is on.\n",
    "- **SG RF Output Level** shows the RF output's level in dB.\n",
    "- **LIA Time Constant** shows the time constant for our lock-in amplifier in seconds.\n",
    "- **LIA Sensivity** shows the absolute largest signal it can measure in the current sensivity setting. The sensivity is in Volts or Amperes depending on the measurement setting.\n",
    "- **Sensivity Delay (s)** is the amount of time (in seconds) paused when the LIA sensivity is changed. This is because some time is required after changing the sensivity before stable reading can be achieved.\n",
    "- **Read Repetitions** is the amount of readings taken per measurement of A and B. More readings give us a more stable, accurate result.\n",
    "- **Read Repetition Delay** is the amount of time (in seconds) between reach read repitition.\n",
    "- **Repetition Averaging Function** is the function which creates a measurement from our repeated readings. By default, this is a simple mean function (`np.mean`). However, sometimes, you want to do more complex averagings than a simple mean. For instance, the experiment class also has a method called `avg_mid_50` which takes in an array as argument, and returns the mean of the middle $50^{th}$ percentile of array elements. This can help stabilise erratic measurements, especially at higher frequencies.\n",
    "- **Read Delay** is the delay (in seconds) after the frequency or field is changed, before a measurement is taken.\n",
    "- **From 0 Delay** is the delay (in seconds) after the frequency or field begins from 0 (occurs when initial parameters are being set), before a measurement is made.\n",
    "- **Log File** is the path to the experiment log file which records every instrument communication. It's always a good idea to look at the log file for clues when things are acting up for unknown reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just some of the experiment parameters which might be useful for you to take note of before your experiment. Of course, you can change most of these."
