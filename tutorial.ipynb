See the experiment [here](https://physlab.org/story/ferromagnetic-resonance-for-investigating-magnetization-dynamics-in-magnetic-thin-films/). We'll be seeing how to run the instruments associated with this lab automatically with some Python code. There are three major instruments:\n",

    "### The GPIB Standard\n",
    "\n",
    "The [General Purpose Interface Bus](https://www.contec.com/support/basic-knowledge/daq-control/gpib-communication/) (GPIB) started off as HPIB (Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus) back when it was an internal interface at HP, way back in the 70s. So if you encounter an older instrument that says it uses HPIB (like our HP 8673G SG), don't worry, it's the same physical connector. The IEEE standardised it with a communications protocol called IEEE-488. Since then, the interface has been approved by the IEEE for standard use and a lot of lab instruments from different manufacturers now feature a GPIB connector. The new protocol enabling standardised use is called IEEE488.2 and it remains to be the modern standard today. This is relevant because our HP 8673G does not support standard IEEE-488.2 commands (but if you're just here to run the FMR experiment, you don't have to worry about this). Although modern lab instruments increasingly feature USB and ethernet connectors, GPIB is still alive and well in many labs today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physically, a GPIB cable usually features a thick wire and 24 pins at the connector. We're not going to get into what each pin is for. The connector comes in plug and receptacle (male and female) forms. The image below shows what a typical GPIB cable looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.meilhaus.de/cosmoshop/default/pix/a/g/1274088903-8796.2.jpg\"  width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the cable from another angle, you'll notice that this particular kind of cable has two connectors per side of the cable, one plug and one receptacle.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://il.farnell.com/productimages/standard/en_GB/1214526-40.jpg\"  width=\"40%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would this be? Turns out, GPIB has many cool tricks up its sleeve, including the possibility of cross-connecting multiple devices so that they all connect to just one port on your computer. This can be done in many ways. You could connect your instruments to a PC in a 'star' configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.contec.com/support/basic-knowledge/daq-control/gpib-communication/-/media/Contec/support/basic-knowledge/daq-control/gpib-communication/images/img_gpib-communication_07.jpg\"  width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This is generally not recommended. A better solution is 'daisy-chaining', where you link all devices in 'series'. This also keeps things cleaner:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.contec.com/support/basic-knowledge/daq-control/gpib-communication/-/media/Contec/support/basic-knowledge/daq-control/gpib-communication/images/img_gpib-communication_06.jpg\"  width=\"50%\">\n",

    "### Software Drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "Where we have hardware (the GPIB interface) we need software to operate it. We have some options here.\n",
    "\n",
    "NI and Keithley both maintain Windows software for VISA-based communication. VISA is the **Virtual Instrument Software Architecture**. The idea is that an experiment can require lab instruments with very different connectors. You might have an instrument with GPIB, one with just a USB port, and one with an RS-232 parallel connector. VISA makes it possible to communicate with instruments in the same manner, regardless of the physical connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyways, NI maintains **NI-VISA** and Keithley maintains the **Keithley I/O Layer**. NI-VISA is more popular/supported and is what we use. Among other things, the software:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provides drivers to use the specific controller\n",
    "2. Provides an API through which IEEE-488.1 and SCPI/IEEE-488.2 commands are sent to instruments under the VISA architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "SCPI is just another layer over the IEEE-488.2 communications standard which standardises the syntax of what we sent to lab instruments. For instance, with SCPI, two voltmeters from different manufacturers might have the same command to make a measurement, `VOLT?`. Commands also are sent as ASCII strings which makes things more comprehensible as well. Note that completely standardised commands are not always necessary nor always possible. So generally, you'll be reading the manual for your respective instrument which should detail what SCPI commands to use for any action.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can *generally* use one manufacturer's VISA software with another manufacturer's GPIB interface. For instance, NI-VISA will automatically detect Keithley KUSB-488A drivers and don't install their own IEEE-488 drivers, allowing you to use the NI-VISA API with the KUSB-488A. This isn't always true for every combination and software version though, and trial and error is necessary."

    "### Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay so we've physically connected the instruments via GPIB to our GPIB controller attached to our computer. We've installed NI-VISA, which automatically installs device drivers for the NI-PCIe-GPIB+ card as well as the API used to send commands. We also have read the instrument's manual to check which commands to send. Now what? Where do I type in these commands? How do I talk to my instruments? Where does Python come in?\n",
    "\n",
    "Good questions! Firstly, when installing NI-VISA or Keithley I/O Layer, the software come with little programs which allow you to detect connected instruments and then send individual commands. They may also come with add-ons which allow programming environments like LabVIEW to interface with these instruments. But to use these software with Python, we need a module called `pyvisa`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pyvisa` acts as a Python wrapper for these software, allowing you to combine instrument communication with the flexibility and power of Python. You can learn more about `pyvisa` from its documentation [here](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/). `pyvisa` allows you to use the NI or Keithley APIs, but also has a native, python based API called `pyvisa-py`. This comes in the shape of a separate module which you can install. However, `pyvisa-py` isn't mature yet and has a lot of missing implementation. This can cause problems in many cases, for instance in use with older instruments. So we use the NI-VISA API with `pyvisa`. This is what our code is built upon."

In that case, closing the figures after the sweeps are done can save memory.\n",
    "- **file_prefix** *string*: The sweep's savefiles usually look something like `'field_100_Oe_freq_3-10_GHz_-3_dB.csv'` by default. If you'd like to add a string before this default fileneme, you can pass it along to the `file_prefix` argument. For example, I can pass along the string `'NiFe_'` here if I'm investigating a NiFe sample to get a filename `'NiFe_field_100_Oe_freq_3-10_GHz_-3_dB.csv'`.\n",
    "- **sen** *float*: Want to start your sweep with a particular sensitivity? Put it in here. The default value is $0.0002$ V.\n",
    "- **sen_delay** *number*: How long (in seconds) do you want to wait before the LIA resumes taking readings after its sensitivity changes? By default this takes $3$ s. This delay is good to have as the LIA needs some time after sensitivity changes in order to stabilise.\n",
    "- **read_reps** *int*: How many readings should the LIA take before making a measurement? This is $1$ by default. More repetitions usually help with unstable readings (especially at higher frequencies).\n",
    "- **rep_delay** *number*: How long (in seconds) do you want to wait in between LIA readings? The default value is $0$ s.\n",
    "- **read_delay** *number*: How long (in seconds) do you want to wait after the frequency or field is changed, before a measurement is taken? The default value is $0$ s.\n",
    "- **from0delay** *number*: How long (in seconds) do you want to wait after the frequency or field begins from $0$ (occurs when initial parameters are being set), before a measurement is made? The default value is $4$ s.\n",
    "- **avg_func** *function*: This is the function which creates a measurement from our repeated readings. By default, this is a simple mean function (`np.mean`). However, sometimes, you want to do more complex averaging than a simple mean. For instance, the experiment class also has a method called `avg_mid_50` which takes in an array as argument, and returns the mean of the middle $50^{th}$ percentile of array elements. This can help stabilise erratic measurements, especially at higher frequencies.\n",
    "- **return_XY** *bool*: Do you want the function to return 2 numpy arrays with the *X* and *Y* values respectively? If so, pass along `True` or `False`. The default value is `False`."

Additionally, the midpoint doesn't exactly seem to be at 3.0 GHz, but this can be because of the wobbles (imagine a positive voltage effect on Channel X and a negative one on Channel Y @ 3.0 GHz) I do not know why, and if you have any ideas, please let me know."
